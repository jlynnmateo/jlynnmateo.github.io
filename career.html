prescribed by their physicians. They also help the doctor be aware of all the facts
they would need to know about thew medication. Some facts would be about the amount
of dosages, or the side effects that could happen when the patient takes the drug.
Pharmacists can identify the medication by their biological, chemical, and physical 
properties.</p>
